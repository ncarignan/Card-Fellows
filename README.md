# Card-Fellows

The purpose of this application is to teach Blackjack. A user can login on the home page and the page will store relevant user data. On the home page will also exist links to display sections about how our site works, the rules of Blackjack and an About Us page. After a user logs in, they will have access to the game page.

The game page is where the bulk of the action will take place. Here the user will play a game of Blackjack, at a table with one dealer and six other players. There will be boxes which display text explaining the various aspects of the game, and the player will be advised on how to play their hand based on best odds, with an explanation why. Whether the player wins or loses will then be added to a record of all the wins and losses.

The stats page will display a history of wins and losses for the currently logged-in user, and it will calculate win percentage based on history. A message here will display regarding the player's results.
