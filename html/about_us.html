        <p> <span class="bigger"> &lt;&spades;&gt; </span> Card Fellows is the brainchild of Nicholas Carignan. Our goal is two-fold; we wanted to build a fun website to play Blackjack on, and also teach the basics of Blackjack and the science behind odds based play. With these ingredients we hope that players will have fun playing while similtaneously reinforcing the knowledge that gambling is a dangerous way to try and make money, and should be done for fun and not for proffit.</p>

        <p>Nicholas Carignan and Andrew Bloom worked long hours crafting the game code, using Nicholas' knowledge of cards to create a solid virtual version of the game. Jeff Martinez put his experience and skills into the meta-game working on stats tracking and data manipulation functions. Dustin Mundy spent his time crafting art assets for the various pages and building the card elements out of CSS and HTML. <span class="bigger"> &lt;/&clubs;&gt; </span> </p>

        <p> <span class="bigger red"> &lt;&hearts;&gt; </span> This has been a wonderful opportunity for us to practice the skillset we have learned over the past month. We challenged ourselves every day during this project, learning new skills and reinforcing ones we already had.</p>

        <p> Special thanks to Sam Hamm, Allie Grampa, Dustin Byers, Amanda Koster, Ron Dunphy and the rest of the CodeFellows staff for guiding us through Code 201. We would never have gotten this far on our own. Thanks to Kerry Nordstrom for the awesome pictures above!<span class="bigger red">&lt;/&diams;&gt;</span> </p>
