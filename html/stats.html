    <p id="welcome" hidden>Welcome to the Stats Page! This is where your game history will be displayed. Go play a few rounds of Blackjack and when you come back here, you'll see a history of your games played and the percentage of games that you've won.</p>
    <p id="winning" hidden>Looks like you're winning a lot! Remember, your odds are the same regardless of how many games you win or lose. Don't book your trip to Vegas just yet!</p>
    <p id="losing" hidden>Looks like you're a little down on your luck. Don't fall into the gambler's fallacy and assume you're about to hit a winning streak. The odds are the same whether you've been winning or losing.</p>
    <p id="trend" hidden>Hey, so you've been playing a while now. I hope you can see that even when you're playing to your best odds, the trend will even out towards winning about 50% of the time.</p>
